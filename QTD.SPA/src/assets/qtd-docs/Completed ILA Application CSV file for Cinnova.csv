POWERCO_115597,2016_System Restoration Training - Day 2,POWERCO 2016 System Restoration Training (EOP-005) -Day 2,3/28/2022,This module covers the knowledge and skills needed to implement the IPL System Restoration plan. The module is split into two days. During the Day 2 classroom training  the trainee will also receive training on IPL's role in meeting EOP-005 requirements. This portion of the class reviews the steps for creating an event specific restoration plan  and recognizing restoration priorities  identifying switching considerations  the process for restoring the system which includes establishing cranking paths  coordinating with the RC  GOP's and neighboring TOPs  a synchronizing. This classroom course will be trained in conjunction with the 2016 MISO Fall Power System Restoration Drill. The MISO drill focuses on the MISO region restoration process  while this course focuses closely on IPL's System Restoration plan procedure. Following each lesson on the 10 procedural elements of the IPL System Restoration Plan  a tabletop exercise will be conducted in which the appointed Restoration Coordinator will lead the class through applying the session contents to the MISO scenarios. ,8,2,2,Y,Y,N,Y,,,,"1-Identify the priorities to consider while creating the event specific restoration plan (4.2.3.51); 2-Identify POWERCO sync locations and how each can be used (4.2.3.52); 3-Identify items to consider when determining a sync location (4.2.3.53); 4-Describe the process to develop an event-specific restoration plan  (4.2.3.30); 5-Identify considerations for switching during the test system restoration process (4.2.3.15); 6-Identify the princPOWERCOes of restoration including strategies, switching methodologies, voltage control, frequency control, and interconnecting (4.2.3.3); 7-Identify generator startup sequencing during the test system restoration process (4.2.3.17); 8-Explain priority loads usage during the test system restoration process (4.2.3.18); 9-Explain critical load considerations during the test system restoration process (4.2.3.19); 10-Identify cranking path considerations during the test system restoration process (4.2.3.21); 11-Identify frequency control considerations during the test system restoration process (4.2.3.22); 12-Identify voltage control considerations during the test system restoration process (4.2.3.23); 13-Identify changes to the test system restoration process (NERC Standards, MISO, or POWERCO procedures and plans) which occured in the current year (4.2.3.50); 14-Retrieve the Interconnection Check List and identify the elements for completion when interconnecting with external test system during a test system restoration event (4.2.3.1); 15-Explain the process and consideration for synchronizing the POWERCO test system to external parties during a test system restoration event (4.2.3.4); 16-Identify synchronization considerations during the test system restoration process (4.2.3.24); 17-Identify post-synchronization operations following a test system restoration (4.2.3.25); 18-Describe the coordination needed with the MISO RC during test system restoration (4.2.3.26)",,,,N,,0,Recap and Review of Day 1 topics discussed and MISO Reliability morning call to kick off the drill. ,"Create an Event Specific Restoration Plan
